HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
This project aims to predict house prices based on various property and location features using data science and machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing historical housing data, we build models that estimate home prices for prospective buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, enabling data-driven decision-making.

In the housing market, pricing is influenced by multiple factors, including location, property size, age, and nearby amenities. This project leverages these features to build a predictive model using machine learning.
The goal is to estimate home prices with accuracy, helping users understand and interpret the factors that contribute most to housing costs.
